# Hive Cube Reference Manual

Hive Cube is an offline task export and Hadoop cluster health status monitoring system that can be exported by selecting table fields, selecting filter conditions, submitting tasks, exporting, or writing custom ```sql```. In addition, the monitoring module monitors the details of the cluster resources consumed by the submission task in real time. In the use of the process if you encounter problems, you can contact the author. Of course, if you are interested, you can also participate in the development of the system to work.
